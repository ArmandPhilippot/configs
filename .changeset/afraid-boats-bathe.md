"@arphi/eslint-config": major

Releases the first version of my shareable ESLint configuration.

This package provides default rules for JavaScript, ESLint comments and imports. Some additional configurations can be activated using a flag:

- TypeScript
- Astro
- React
- JSDoc
- Prettier
- Tests

The exported function lets you activate the optional configurations and override rules if needed. In addition, you can pass one or more custom configurations after the first argument.
